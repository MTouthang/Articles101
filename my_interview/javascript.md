#1. Looping with `for loop` vs `Map method`
- Both the `for` loop and `map` method can be used to iterate over an array and perform a function on each element.
- However, the map method is often preferred because it is more concise and easier to read, and it also returns a new array with the modified elements, whereas the for loop modifies the original array.
- In map method we dont need to specifies when the loop will end while in for loop, loop termination should be specified.
- Map method takes a callback function.
